# 1. Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data      # Features (flower measurements)
y = iris.target    # Target (flower species)

# 2. Split dataset into training and testing sets

# 3. Initialize KNN model
# n_neighbors = 3 → looks at 3 nearest neighbors to classify
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# 4. Train the model
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Make predictions
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# 6. Evaluate model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Sample predictions
